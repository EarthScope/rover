Commands needed for setting up a development environment, building wheels,
and uploading to PyPI

# Development environment

## Create the development environment, only needed once
python3 -m venv devenv

## Activate the development environment
source ./devenv/bin/activate

## Install the module locally using the source in-place
python3 -m pip install --editable .

# Testing

The package must be installed to be tested because the C library
must be compiled and this is done during packaging.

python3 -m pip install pytest robot
pytest

# Update release version

The single-source package version is specified in:
src/rover/__version__.py

The versioning follows the semantic versioning definition.

# Building distribution packages

## Ensure required build modules are installed
python3 -m pip install build twine

## Build sdist
python3 -m build --sdist

## Test and upload to PyPI
python3 -m twine check --strict dist/*
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
