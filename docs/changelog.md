## Change Log 

ROVER's official change log is its [Github releases page](https://github.com/EarthScope/rover/releases).  The preferred installation method for ROVER is [via PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rover/) most commonly used with `pip`.  We do not recommend downloading releases from the GitHub project directly.
