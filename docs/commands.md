## Normal Usage


### Init Repository

    rover init-repository [directory]

    rover init-repo [directory]

    rover init [directory]

`init-repository` generates a rover.config file containing ROVER's default configuration parameters; a rover.config file, a data directory, and a logs directory to a target path.

To avoid over-writing data, `rover init-repository` returns an error if the command's target directory contains the file rover.config, or the directories data or logs.

##### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |
| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

##### Examples

    rover init-repository

will create the repository in the current directory.

    rover init-repository ~/ROVER

will create the repository in ~/ROVER

    

### Retrieve

    rover retrieve file

    rover retrieve [net=N] [sta=S] [loc=L] [cha=C] [begin [end]]

    rover retrieve N_S_L_C [begin [end]]

`rover retrieve` post a URL request to the availability service defined in rover.config. Returned availability data is compared with a local repository's index using maximal timespans across quality and sample rates. Data not available in the local repository are downloaded, ingested, and the index is updated. Retrieve reindexes the local repository before comparing to account for modified data. 

File arguments must only contain a list of text strings following the pattern `net sta loc cha YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` where the first date-string occurs prior to the second date-string. Wild cards of `*` or `?` are accepted to partially or fully replace `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha` arguments. Starttime and endtime arguments cannot be assigned as a wildcard. For non-file arguments One or more `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha` input arguments must be provided; missing values are taken as wildcards.  

During the retrieve process, the command's status is available at `http://localhost:8000` (default configuration). Users can provide an email address that is notified upon completion of `rover retrieve`.

See `rover subscribe` for similar functionality, but with regular updates.
#### Errors, Retries and Consistency

ROVER retrieve will repeat until no errors occur and no more data is downloaded or its configurable limit of download attempts returning 0 bytes of data, set by `download-retries`, is reached. Upon apparent process completion an additional retrieval is made, which should result in no data being downloaded. If data are downloaded during the additional retrieval phase then the data availability and web services servers are inconsistent.

Inconsistencies cause ROVER processes to exit with an error status and are reported in the logs directory and via the configurable email parameter.

displays data that are available in the host repository but are missing from the local repository.

    rover list-retrieve IU.ANMO.00.BH1 2017-01-01 2017-01-04

displays data that are available in the host repository but are missing from the local repository.


### List Index

    rover list-index [net=...|sta=...|loc=...|cha=..|qua=...|samp=...]* [begin=...] [end=...] \
    [count|join|join-qsr]

    rover list-index [N_S_L_C_Q]* [begin=...] [end=...] \
    [count|join|join-qsr]

`list_index` returns data available in the local repository (config parameter data-dir) that match given arguments. `list_index` accepts arguments of net=XX  sta=XXXX loc=XX cha=XXX qua=XX samp=XXX  begin=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss end=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss. Wild cards of `*` or `?` are accepted to partially or fully replace `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha`, `qua`, `samp` arguments. Starttime and endtime arguments cannot be assigned a wildcard. One or more `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha`,  `qua`, `samp`  input arguments must be provided; missing values are taken as wildcards.  
  Alternatively, a N_S_L_C begin=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss end=YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss can be supplied as arguments. N_S_L_C  can be truncated to the station level. 


Flag parameters used to change the output format are optional arguments. Flags are mutually exclusive and take no value:

 ` count - displays the total number of matches.`

  `join - displays data available as continuous time ranges separated by data quality and sample rate. `

  `join-qsr - displays the maximal timespan across all quality and sample rates, similar to the process `retrieve`.`
  


#### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| timespan-tol        | 0.5                  | Fractional tolerance for overlapping timespans (samples) |
| data-dir            | data                 | The data directory - data, timeseries.sqlite |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |
| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

#### Examples

    rover list-index IU_ANMO_00_BH? count

displays the total number of entries for all time, data quality, and sample rate.

    rover list-index net=* begin=2001-01-01

lists all available data in the local repository after the year 2000.

  Note that console logging is to stderr, while the command results are listed to stdout.


### List Summary

    rover list-summary [net=...|sta=...|loc=...|cha=..]* [begin=...] [end=...]

    rover list-summary [N_S_L_C_Q]* [begin=...] [end=...]

`list_summary` returns data available in the local repository (config parameter data-dir) that match given arguments. 
The summary entries are pre-calculated and record the whole time span, from the earliest to the latest data. `list-summary` is faster than `list-index` but shows less information.

Please note that console logging is to stderr, while the command results are listed to stdout.

#### Net_Sta_Loc_Chan

Query parameters can be named (network, station, location, channel) and unambiguous abbreviations are accepted.  Alternatively, a N_S_L_C can be supplied. N_S_L_C can be truncated on the right, but must contain at least one underscore.

Wildcards '*' and '?' can be used.

#### Time Range

The 'begin' and 'end' parameters can be provided only once per request.  They must be in the form YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSS, which may be truncated on the right. 'begin' and 'end' define a time range from which data are queried. 

##### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| data-dir            | data                 | The data directory - data, timeseries.sqlite |

| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

#### Examples

    rover list-summary net=* begin=2001-01-01

list all entries in the summary after the year 2000.

## Advanced Usage (Daemon Mode)


### Subscribe

    rover subscribe file

    rover subscribe [net=N] [sta=S] [loc=L] [cha=C] [begin [end]]

    rover subscribe N_S_L_C [begin [end]]

`subscribe` generates a background service (daemon) that regularly compares data available at the configured server with the local repository. If there is a discrepancy, available data is downloaded, ingested and indexed. `subscribe` is similar to `rover retrieve` but uses a daemon to regularly update the local repository. `rover start` begins the subscription service.  See also `rover status` and `rover stop`.

The file argument should contain a list of Net_Sta_Loc_Chans and timespans, as appropriate for calling an Availability service (eg http://service.iris.edu/irisws/availability/1/).


File arguments must only contain a list of text strings following the pattern `net sta loc cha YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` where the first date-string occurs prior to the second date-string. Wild cards of `*` or `?` are accepted to partially or fully replace `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha` arguments. Starttime and endtime arguments cannot be assigned as a wildcard. For non-file arguments one or more `net`, `sta`, `loc`, `cha` input arguments must be provided; missing values are taken as wildcards.  

`subscribe` periodically retrieves a list of available data from a server's availability service and compares it with the local index.  Data not available locally are downloaded and ingested. Availability service data are compared with the local repository's index using maximal timespans across quality and sample rates. A list of requested data available at the server that are not present in the local repository is returned. The returned list determines the data that is downloaded and ingested for the server's data services. 

A user may have multiple subscriptions (see `rover list-subscribe`), but to avoid downloading duplicate data they must not describe overlapping data.  To enforce this, requests are checked on submission.

##### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| availability-url    | http://service.iris.edu/irisws/availability/1/query | Availability service url       |
| dataselect-url      | http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query | Dataselect service url         |
| force-request       | False                | Skip overlap checks (dangerous)? |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |
| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

Most of the download process is controlled by the parameters provided when starting the service (see `rover start`).

##### Examples

    rover subscribe N_S_L_C.txt

will instruct the daemon to periodically download, ingest, and index any data missing from the repository for NSLCs / timespans in the given file.

    rover subscribe IU_ANMO_00_BH1 2017-01-01 2075-01-04

will instruct the daemon to periodically download, ingest and index data for IU.ANMO.00.BH1. ROVER subscribe can be set into the future to update a local repository in semi-real time.

    

### Start

Start the background (daemon) process to support `rover subscribe`.

See also `rover stop`, `rover status` and `rover daemon`.

##### Significant Parameters

| email-from          | noreply@rover        | From address for email         |
| smtp-address        | localhost            | Address of SMTP server         |
| smtp-port           | 25                   | Port for SMTP server           |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |

| dev                 | False                | Development mode (show exceptions)? |

In addition, parameters relevant to the processing pipeline (see `rover retrieve`, or the individual commands for download, ingest and index) will apply.

Logging for individual processes in the pipeline will automatically be configured with `--unique-logs --log-verbosity 3`. For most worker tasks, that will give empty logs (no warnings or errors), which will be automatically deleted (see `rover download`).  To preserve logs, and to use the provided verbosity level, start the daemon with `--dev`,

When the daemon is running status should be visible at http://localhost:8000 (by default).  When a subscription is processed an email can be sent to the user (if `--email` is used).

#### Errors, Retries and Consistency

Similar to `rover retrieve`, `subscribe` will repeat until no errors occur and no more data is downloaded or its configurable limit of download attempts returning 0 bytes of data, set by `download-retries`, is reached. Upon apparent process completion an additional retrieval is made, which should result in no data being downloaded. If data are downloaded during the additional retrieval phase then the data availability and web services servers are inconsistent.

Errors and inconsistencies are reported in the logs and in the optional email (`email` parameter) sent to the user.

##### Examples

    rover start -f /path/to/rover.config

will start the daemon using the given configuration file.

    rover start --recheck-period 24

will start the daemon, processing subscriptions every 24 hours.

    

### Stop

Stop the background (daemon) process to support `rover subscribe`.

See also `rover start`, `rover status`.

##### Examples

    rover unsubscribe 1:3

will delete subscriptions 1, 2 and 3.

    

### Trigger

    rover trigger N[:M]+

Ask the daemon to re-process a subscription(s) based on its index. `rover list-subscribe` displays subscriptions indices. `tirgger` accepts integers or ranges of integers (N:M) as arguments.

More exactly, this command resets the "last checked" date in the database, so when the daemon re-checks the database ,typically once per minute, it will process the subscription.

#### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| data-dir            | data                 | The data directory - data, timeseries.sqlite |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |
| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

##### Examples

    rover trigger 2

will ask the daemon to re-process subscription 2.

    
## Low-Level Commands

The following commands are used internally, but are usually not useful
from the command line:


### Download


    rover download url [path]

    rover download file [path]

`rover download` downloads a single request, typically for a day, from a URL or a given file. File arguments are expected to contain fdsn web services requests and fetch data from the configured URL set by the parameter `dataselect-url` in rover.config. Requested data are downloaded, ingested, and indexed to a local repository. The path argument of `rover download` sets the location of the repository.  If no path is given, than a temporary file is created and deleted after use.

ROVER will treat an input argument as an URL if it contains the characters "://". The URL argument must point towards fdsnws-dataselect services, and can not request data that spans multiple calendar days. `rover retrieve` generates workers that call `rover download` in the terminal. 

`download` is the main low-level task called in the processing pipeline. Each instances of download calls ingest and index as long as they are configured as true. To reduce the quantity of unhelpful logs generated when a pipeline is running, empty logs are automatically deleted on exit.

##### Significant Parameters

|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |

| log-dir             | logs                 | Directory for logs             |
| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

Parameters used to configure the sub-commands ingest, index are also applicable - see Ingest/Index help for more details.

##### Examples

    rover download \
    'http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/query?net=IU&sta=ANMO&loc=00&cha=BHZ&start=2010-02-27T06:30:00.000&end=2010-02-27T10:30:00.000'

will download, ingest and index data from the given URL.

    rover download myrequest.txt

will download, ingest and index data from `dataselect-url` after POSTing `myrequest.txt`.


### Ingest

    rover ingest file

Adds contents from a miniSEED formatted file to ROVER's local repository and indexes the new data.

The `mseedindex` command indexes blocks of data present in the miniSEED file. Data within byte ranges mapped by `mseedindex` are then appended to the appropriate files in the repository.

The input miniseed file should not contain data spanning multiple calendar days.

Parameters used to configure the sub-command index are also applicable - see Index help for more details.

##### Examples

    rover ingest /tmp/IU.ANMO.00.*.mseed

will add all data from the specified file to the repository.


### Index

    rover index [--all]

    rover index (file|dir)+

Indexes files, adds or changes entires in the tsindex table stored in the miniSEED database.

When no argument is given, all modified files in the repository are processed. The `--all` flag forces all files to be processed. If a directory argument is provided, all files contained in the directory are processed, along with the contents of sub-directories, unless `--no-recurse` is specified.

`rover index` uses the command `mseedindex` at its core. `mseedindex` optionally uses a file of leap-second data.  By default, unless configured `--no-leap`, the leap-second file is downloaded from `--leap-url` if the file currently at `--leap-file` is missing or older than `--leap-expire` days.

In addition, parameters relevant to the processing pipeline apply. Processing pipeline commands include `rover retrieve` or its subprocesses download, ingest and index.

Logging for processes in the pipeline are automatically configured with `--unique-logs --log-verbosity 3`. To preserve logs, and used the default verbosity level, start the daemon with the flag `--dev`. When the daemon is running it's status should be visible at http://localhost:8000 (by default).  When a subscription is processed an email can be sent to the user if the `--email` flag is configured.

#### Errors, Retries and Consistency

Subscriptions are re-processed until no errors occur and data appear to be complete, or the configured maximum download retries limit is reached. Once a retrieval with no errors or downloads occurs, an additional retrieval is made, which should result in no data being downloaded. If the additional retrieval leads to a data download- than the availabilty services and web services are inconsistent.

Errors and inconsistencies are reported in the terminal, logs, and an optional email (`email` parameter) sent to the user.

##### Examples

    rover daemon -f roverrc

will start the daemon in the foreground using the given configuration file.

    rover start --recheck-period 24

will start the daemon in the foreground, processing subscriptions every 24 hours.

ROVER start is the perferred method to launch the subscription service. 

    

### Web

    rover web

    rover web --http-bind-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080

    rover start --web ...   # the default

    rover retrieve --web ...   # the default

Starts a web server that provides information on the progress of the download manager, the core of the `rover daemon` and `rover retrieve` commands. ROVER's default configuration starts `rover web` automatically, provided `--no-web` is not used with `rover retrieve` or `rover start`. Empty logs are removed on exit to avoid cluttering the log directory.

##### Significant Parameters


|  Name               | Default              | Description                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| web                 | True                 | Auto-start the download progress web server? |
| http-bind-address   | 127.0.0.1            | Bind address for HTTP server   |
| http-port           | 8000                 | Port for HTTP server           |
| verbosity           | 4                    | Console verbosity (0-6)        |

| log-verbosity       | 4                    | Log verbosity (0-6)            |

##### Examples

    rover start --no-web

will start the daemon without the web server.



### Retrieve-metadata

    rover retrieve-metadata

Download missing metadata from the fdsnws-station web service and save to the
data archive. This feature is only supported for the ASDF output format.

Errors, Retries and Consistency

If `download-retries` allows, retrievals are repeated until no errors occur
and, once data appear to be complete, an additional retrieval is made which
should result in no data being downloaded.  If this is not the case - if
additional data are found - then the web services are inconsistent.

If `force-metadata-reload` is True then already loaded metadata will be
downloaded and overwritten.

Errors and inconsistencies are reported in the logs and in the optional email
(`email` parameter) sent to the user. They also cause the command to exit with
an error status.
