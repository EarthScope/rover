# ROVER Configuration

ROVER can be configured via a file or by using command line options
or a combination of the two.  Option names are the same in both cases.

## File Configuration

ROVER's configuration file, normally named rover.config, contains all
options for a ROVER repository. A default config is is created when a
ROVER repository is initialized.

By default `rover.config` is searched for in the current working
directory, allowing for rover commands to be run without specifying
a config file.

To explicitly use a configuration file, the `-f` or `--file` option
followed by a path to the configuration file can be included when
calling ROVER, e.g.:

    rover -f /PATH/TO/rover.config

Use a text editor to change option values in the rover.config file.
Lines starting with `#` are comments.

## Command Line Configuration

Options can be directly specified on the command line.
For example, the `verbosity` option could be assigned
when running ROVER:

    rover --verbosity 6 ...

Boolean options follow different syntax when assigned through the
command prompt versus a config file. In the terminal,
boolean options are interperted as flags, which can be
negated by prefixing the option's name with `no-`:

    rover --web ...

or

    rover --no-web ...

Available options are displayed using `rover -h` or `rover -H`,
with the later syntax showing the full help with all options.

## Default Configuration

ROVER's default configuration is written to a file named `rover.config`
when a new repository is initialized using the command:

    rover init-repository /PATH/TO/DATAREPO

By default, a repository is arranged in the following structure:

    DATAREPO/
       +- rover.config
       +- leap-seconds.list
       +- logs/
       |  +- ...
       +- data/
       |  +- timeseries.sqlite
       |  +- ...
       +- tmp/
          +- ...

All of these base directory and file locations can be specified
using rover options.
