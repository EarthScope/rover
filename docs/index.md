## Description

ROVER is a command line tool to robustly retrieve geophysical timeseries data from data centers such as [EarthScope](https://www.earthscope.org/data/). It builds an associated index for downloaded data to generate a local repository. ROVER compares a built local index to timeseries availability information provided by the datacenter. This enables a local archive to remain synchronized with a remote data center.

## Installation <a id="installation"></a>

ROVER is a command-line tool that requires Python 2.7, 3.6.2 or a later. Python 3.7 or above running on Linux or macOS are known to work best (pre-installed versions of Python available on some operating systems, such as macOS, may not support ROVER installation or operation without additional work). We suggest installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 3 (or the full [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) if you wish) for the best results.

### Option 1

ROVER requires the `C` language program [mseedindex](https://github.com/EarthScope/mseedindex) be available on the system's path. A `C` compiler and the `make` program are required to build mseedindex. ROVER and mseedindex may be downloaded and compiled simultaneously using pip:

    pip install rover[mseedindex]

### Option 2
Alternatively, ROVER and mseedindex may be installed independently.

[mseedindex](https://github.com/EarthScope/mseedindex) may be downloaded and compiled following the [mseedindex install guidelines](mseedindex.md). Similar to installation option 1, building mseedindex is dependent upon the `make` program and a `C` compiler.

Once mseedindex is configured and availble on the system's path, use `pip` to install ROVER and its other Python requirements:

    pip install rover

You should now be able to type `rover --version` to see if it was successfully installed.

## Quick start <a id="quickstart"></a>

Initialize a data repository, which creates the `datarepo` directory, and change into the new directory:

    rover init-repository datarepo
    cd datarepo

Create a request file named `request.txt` containing:

    IU ANMO * LHZ 2012-01-01T00:00:00 2012-02-01T00:00:00
    TA MSTX -- BH? 2012-01-01T00:00:00 2012-02-01T00:00:00

Run the process `rover retrieve` to fetch these data:

   ```
   rover retrieve request.txt
   ```

`list-summary` prints the retrieved data from the earliest to the latest timespans:

   ```
   rover list-summary

      IU_ANMO_00_LHZ 2012-01-01T00:00:00.069500 2012-01-31T23:59:59.069500
      IU_ANMO_10_LHZ 2012-01-01T00:00:00.069500 2012-01-31T23:59:59.069500
      TA_MSTX__BHE 2012-01-01T00:00:00.000000 2012-01-31T23:59:59.975000
      TA_MSTX__BHN 2012-01-01T00:00:00.000000 2012-01-31T23:59:59.975000
      TA_MSTX__BHZ 2012-01-01T00:00:00.000000 2012-01-31T23:59:59.975000
   ```

Retrieved files are miniSEED format containing day lengths of station data. The files are saved with the path structure:

   ```
   <datarepo>/data/<network>/<year>/<day>/<station>.<network>.<year>.<day>
   ```
## Exploring ROVER

ROVER has built-in help. The command `rover help` prints a ROVER introduction to the terminal.

There are many more options available in ROVER including; the ability to send emails that monitor
ROVER request and subscriptions (see the `--email` option), view listings of contiguous traces (via the `rover list-index join` command), or view the status of a long-running download using a web browser (by default at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)).`rover help help` prints a list of [commands](commands.md) available in the ROVER code suite.

ROVER is configurable via the rover.config file or by using the command line. Type `rover -h` to see the configuration parameters that are adjustable using the command line.

For more detailed examples, see more [example commands to download data](download.md) and [example commands to manage and maintain the local repository](maintenance.md).
