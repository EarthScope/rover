                    Common ROVER Commands

rover {0} [directory]

  Initializes a given directory, or the current directory
  if no argument is provided, as a ROVER data repository.
  %s will create a configuration file, by default {0},
  as well as directories for logs and data.

  The aliases `rover {1}` and `rover {2}` also exist.

rover {3} (file | sta=... [start [end]] | N_S_L_C [start [end]])

  Compares ROVER's local index with remotely available data,
  then downloads and ingest files missing from the local
  repository. The location of remote data availability is
  determined by the config parameter {4}, and the data is
  downloaded from the URL that is configured by the parameter {5}.
  Use %s to determine data available on the remote server which
  is not in the local repository.

rover {6} (file | sta=... [start [end]] | N_S_L_C [start [end]])

  Compares the local index with the data available remotely,
  then displays the difference. Note that the summary is
  printed to stdout, while logging is to stderr.

rover {7} ...

  List index entries for the repository, config parameter %s,
  that match the given constraints. For more information,
  run "rover %s" with no arguments.

rover {8} ...

  List summary entries for the repository, config parameter
  {9}, that match the given constraints.  This is faster than
  `rover {8}` but gives less detail.  For more information,
  run "rover {10}" with no arguments.

                   Advanced ROVER Commands

rover {0}

  Start the background process that regularly downloads subscriptions.

rover {1}

rover {2}

  Display the status of, and stop, the background process.

rover {3} (file | sta=... [start [end]] | N_S_L_C [start [end]])

  Subscribe generates a background service (daemon) that regularly compares data
  available at the configured server with the local repository. If there is a
  discrepancy, available data is downloaded, ingested and indexed. `rover {3}` is
  similar to `rover {4}` but uses a daemon to regularly update the local repository.

rover {5}

rover {5} N

  Displays indices of all ROVER subscriptions. `rover {5}` is similar to
  `rover {6}`.

rover {7} N

  Ask the daemon to immediately re-process a subscription(s) based
  on the subscription's index.

rover {8} N

  Delete one or more subscriptions identified by their indices.
  Data associated with the subscription(s) is not deleted.

                   Low-Level ROVER Commands

The following commands are used internally, and are often less
useful from the command line:

rover {0} url

  Downloads a single request, typically for a day, from a URL
  or a given file. File arguments are expected to contain fdsn
  web services requests and fetch data from the URL set by the
  parameter {1}. Data are downloaded to a temporary directory
  configured by the parameter {2}. After downloaded, data are
  ingested into the {3} repository and are deleted from the temp
  directory. `rover {0}` is called by {4}, {5}, and {6}.

rover {7} (file|dir) ...

  Adds contents from a miniSEED formatted file to ROVER's local
  repository and indexes the new data.

rover {8} [(file|dir) ...]

  Indexes files, adds or changes entries in the tsindex table
  stored in the miniSEED database.

  When no argument is given, all modified files in the
  repository are processed. The `--all` flag forces
  all files to be processed. If a directory argument
  is provided, all files contained in the directory are
  processed, along with the contents of sub-directories,
  unless `--no-recurse` is specified.

rover {9}

  Creates a summary of the index stored in a ROVER repository.
  This lists the overall span of data for each
  Net_Sta_Loc_Chan and can be queried using `rover {10}`.

rover {11}

  Download missing metadata from the fdsnws-station web service and save to the
  data archive. This feature is only supported for the ASDF output format.
